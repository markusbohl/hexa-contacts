# hexa-contacts

A simple pet project to familiarize myself with the principles of **hexagonal architecture** (aka 
**Ports & Adapters**), **TypeScript**, **Angular**, and **Node.js**.

In case *hexagonal architecture* doesn't ring a bell with you a good starting point might be this great [blog post][1] by Chris Fidao.


## Application Example

To focus mainly on architecture and the new tools/frameworks the use cases and algorithms have deliberately been kept quite simple. The application example is some sort of address book where contacts are organized. At a first stage, basic CRUD operations via REST-Services should be possible. Later on, a web client should be added.

We'll see how the code evolves.
